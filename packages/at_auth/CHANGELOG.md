## 3.4.0
Adds a web-safe barrel. **Nothing breaks**: `at_auth.dart` still carries the
whole package, `FileAtKeysIo` included, and the defaults it used to apply are
still applied on any `dart:io` host. Web builds import `at_auth_web.dart`
instead.

- feat: add `package:at_auth/at_auth_web.dart` — at_auth's platform-neutral
  surface, naming no `dart:io` type. It is a *narrowing* of `at_auth.dart`, not a
  different API: `AtAuth`, `AtEnrollment`, `AtKeys`, the `AtKeysIo` interfaces,
  `InMemoryAtKeysIo`, the serialization layer, the session models and
  `RegistrarService` are all there, and code written against it runs unchanged on
  native. What it omits is `FileAtKeysIo` (a browser has no filesystem) and
  `secureSocketProbe` (no raw sockets).
- feat: `AtAuthImpl.probeSocket` is now a public constructor parameter and field,
  typed by the new exported `AtServerProbe` typedef, and `AtAuth.create` forwards
  it. It defaults to the newly-exported `secureSocketProbe` — the TLS
  connect-and-drop `AtAuthImpl` has always used — on a `dart:io` host, and to
  null on web/WASM. When it is null `validateAtServer` skips the readiness probe
  and polls only the atDirectory, logging a warning to say so.
- feat: `onboard()`'s `atKeysIo` default is now platform-conditional. On a
  `dart:io` host it is still `FileAtKeysIo()` at the standard
  `~/.atsign/keys/<atsign>_key.atKeys` path, exactly as before. On web/WASM there
  is no default, and supplying neither `atKeys` nor `atKeysIo` throws
  `AtAuthenticationException` naming `atKeysIo` and pointing at
  `InMemoryAtKeysIo`.
- fix: `RegistrarService` now validates the registrar's TLS certificate. It built
  its own `dart:io` `HttpClient` with `badCertificateCallback => true`, which
  accepted **any** certificate unconditionally; it now uses `http.Client()` from
  `package:http`, which also works on the web via fetch. This is the one
  behavioural change in this release: pass your own permissive client through the
  existing `httpClient` constructor parameter if you were relying on the old
  behaviour. at_onboarding_cli's `--allow-bad-registrar-certs` is unaffected — it
  builds its own client and never goes through `RegistrarService`.
- fix: `validateAtServer` no longer special-cases `SocketException` when logging
  a failed attempt — the probe transport is the caller's choice now, so it cannot
  assume a `dart:io` exception type. Every attempt failure logs at `severe`;
  previously probe failures logged at `warning`.
- chore: internal layout for the split — the three `dart:io` touchpoints move out
  of `at_auth_impl.dart` into `src/io/` (`probe.dart`, plus a
  `defaults_io.dart` / `defaults_stub.dart` pair selected by
  `if (dart.library.io)`). `src/keys/io/file_io.dart` did not move; only its
  barrel membership changed.

  Note the split is held by barrel discipline, not by the compiler: `dart compile
  wasm` **accepts** `dart:io` and defers the failure to a runtime
  `UnsupportedError`, so importing `at_auth.dart` in a browser build compiles
  clean and then throws on first file or socket use. Importing `at_auth_web.dart`
  is what avoids that.

  This also does not yet make at_auth *run* on the web: `at_lookup`'s socket
  transport still needs porting. See `docs/projects/wasm/plan.md`.

## 3.3.0
- feat: add `AtAuthSession` (exported) — the explicit auth→client hand-off artifact: the confirmed subset of an auth request that client creation actually needs (`atSign`, `rootDomain`, `namespace`, `atKeysIo`, `enrollmentId`), promoted to its own type so "request" no longer doubles as "session". Keys cross the boundary as an `AtKeysIo` *source*, not as live crypto state: the client derives its own `AtKeys` via `atKeysIo.read(atSign)` rather than adopting auth's `AtChops`/`AtLookUp`. The session also carries auth's already-authenticated `atLookUp` so a caller can *opt in* to reusing that connection (`AtClientManager.fromAuthSession(session, reuse: true)`) and skip a second PKAM handshake; the default hand-off rebuilds a fresh connection.
- feat: `AtAuthImpl.authenticate(...)` and `.onboard(...)` populate the new `AuthResponse.session` on success whenever the request supplied an `atKeysIo` — pass it straight to `AtClientManager.fromAuthSession(...)`. The legacy `atAuthKeys`-only path has no key source to hand across, so it gets no session and keeps behaving exactly as before.
- feat: `AtEnrollmentRequest` now takes a `session` (the requesting app's atSign, rootDomain and the `atKeysIo` its new keys will be persisted into) in place of the individual `atSign`/`rootDomain`/`apkamPublicKey`/`encryptedAPKAMSymmetricKey` params. On approval, `waitForApproval(...)` flushes the completed keyset into `session.atKeysIo` (when it is a `WrittenAtKeysIo`) and hands back a ready-to-use `AtEnrollmentResponse.session`. Supplying neither `session` nor the deprecated `atSign` throws `ArgumentError`. The legacy path (no session, or a read-only `AtKeysIo`) leaves `atAuthKeys` populated for the caller to persist and sets `session` to null.
- deprecation: everything the `AtAuthSession` hand-off replaces is marked `@Deprecated(... 'remove in v4')` and still fully functional in 3.3.0 — `AuthResponse` and its `AtAuthResponse`/`AtOnboardingResponse` subclasses, the `atAuthKeys`/`atLookUp`/`atChops` response fields, `AtEnrollmentResponse.atSign`/`.rootDomain`/`.atAuthKeys`, and the `AtEnrollmentRequest` params listed above. No runtime behaviour changed; this release is additive so consumers can migrate to `session` before at_auth 4.
- feat: add `AtKeysMaterial` — the only key type `AtKeys`'s API deals in (`addKey`, `getKey`, `keysForKeyId`, `keysForEnrollment`, `retireKey`, the `keysList` constructor param, ...). It's fully self-describing: `keyId`/`enrollmentId` plus `keyPartType` (an open `String` — the mechanical crypto role; known tokens in `CryptographicKeyType`: symmetric encryption/authentication and the public/private halves of encryption, verification/signing, encapsulation/decapsulation and key agreement), `keyAlgorithmType` (an open `String` — the algorithm family; known tokens in `KeyAlgorithmType`: `aes256`/`rsa2048`/`ecc_secp256r1`/`ed25519`/`x25519`/`mlkem768`/`mldsa65`/`xwing`, matching the pkam/enrollment `signingAlgo` literals), `bytes`, `operations`, `createdAt`, and `status` (`active`/`retired`/`dead`; `withStatus(...)` copies a material at a new status). Both token fields are deliberately Strings, not enums: unknown tokens are preserved and round-tripped, so a keyfile written by a newer client stays readable — and losslessly flushable — by an older one; whether an algorithm is classical, post-quantum or hybrid is carried by the algorithm token (e.g. `xwing`), not a separate role axis. The wire's nested `keys[].keyParts[]` document shape — grouping the materials sharing a `keyId` (e.g. the public+private halves of a keypair) — is produced/consumed by `encodeAtKeysDocument`/`parseAtKeysDocument` (also exported), not a separate model type. Keys produced by one enrollment are grouped by an optional `enrollmentId` and queried via `AtKeys.keysForEnrollment(...)`; at most one material of a given `CryptographicKeyType` may share an `enrollmentId`.
- feat: `AtKeys.toJson()`/`.fromJson(...)` now produce/consume the versioned typed-keys document shape (`version`, `atsign`, `keys`, with legacy fields flat at the top level — upgrading a legacy file to the typed-keys document is additive, not a format swap), replacing the former codec/resolver/document layer. Backward compatible: `fromJson` accepts json without a `version` field as the legacy flat shape, and throws `AtKeysUnsupportedVersionException` on an unknown version. Typed materials are looked up via `AtKeys.getKey(keyId, type)` and `.keysForKeyId(keyId)`.
- feat: add `WrittenAtKeysIo.flush(Atsign, AtKeys)` — the runtime persist operation: mutate the in-memory `AtKeys` (`addKey`, `retireKey`, ...), then flush the complete state. On an existing file, flush safety-checks the rewrite (`AtKeysAssurance.validateMapUpdate` — nothing may be lost: every existing `(keyId, keyPartType)` must survive with identical fields, though `status` may move forward `active` → `retired` → `dead` and new materials may be added), then rewrites; flushing a legacy `.atKeys` file upgrades it in place to the typed-keys document format (legacy fields preserved byte-for-byte). On a missing file, flush creates it. `write(...)` stays the create-only initial persist. (The `append`/`save` methods that existed briefly during this release's development are gone — never published.) `FileAtKeysIo` writes are atomic (write-to-temp + rename, so a crash can never truncate the keyfile) and a flush over an existing file first preserves it as `<file>.bak`.
- feat: `AtKeysAssurance` is now the single home for all atKeys validation — both the low-level `expect*`/`optional*` value/type checks used by `AtKeysMaterial.fromJson`/`AtKeys.fromJson`, and the structural invariants (`validateKeyMaterials`: duplicate `keyId`, one material of each `CryptographicKeyType` per enrollment, the flush-safety check `validateMapUpdate`).
- feat: add passphrase envelope support via `AtKeysPassphraseEnvelopeCodec` (`encode`/`decode`/`isEnvelope`, argon2id key derivation), and add `InMemoryAtKeysIo` for in-memory/test flows (both exported).
- fix: `AtKeys.==`/`hashCode` now also cover `atsign`, `metadata` (compared structurally — nested maps/lists by value, not identity) and the typed key materials (order-insensitive).
- chore(deps): require `at_chops` ^3.4.1 for hashing algorithm barrel exports used by AtKeys passphrase handling.
- fix: `RegistrarService` now fails loudly on a bad API key instead of reporting
  an ordinary negative result. The constructor throws `AtException` when `apiKey`
  is empty or whitespace-only, and every registrar call that requires
  authentication throws `AtException` naming the endpoint and status code when
  the registrar answers 401/403. Previously a rejected key surfaced as
  `sendActivationOtp()` returning `false` (or an empty atsign list), which is
  indistinguishable from a legitimate "no" — callers that treated a falsy result
  as an expected outcome will now see an exception (#1909).

## 3.2.0
- feat: bound `AtAuthImpl.validateAtServer` with a single overall deadline so a
  dead network can no longer hang authentication/onboarding. `RetryOptions` gains
  an optional `overallTimeout`; when null the default depends on the request:
  authentication uses `AtNetworkTimeouts.effectiveDefault` (30s) so a dead network
  fails fast, while ONBOARDING uses `AtNetworkTimeouts.defaultOnboardingTimeout`
  (5 min) because a newly-registered atSign can take minutes to be provisioned.
  The loop is deadline-driven — it retries every `retryDelay` until the budget is
  spent, then throws `AtTimeoutException`; each inner network call (the atDirectory
  lookup and the connectivity probe) is bounded by the remaining budget and capped
  at 60s. **`RetryOptions.maxRetries` no longer bounds this loop** (the deadline
  does) (#1923). Requires `at_commons ^5.13.0`.
- chore(deps): `at_lookup: ^3.6.0` — `validateAtServer` passes the `timeout`
  parameter that `SecondaryAddressFinder.findSecondary` gained in at_lookup
  3.6.0, so this version does not compile against at_lookup ≤3.5.x.

## 3.1.1
- refactor: route enrollment RSA (encrypt/decrypt `apkamSymmetricKey` under the default encryption keypair) through at_chops (`RsaEncryptionAlgo`) — `crypton` no longer imported in `lib` and moved to `dev_dependencies` (only the enrollment test still uses it for RSA keypair fixtures). Same framing, byte-identical by construction.
- fix: `decodeAtKeys()` now reliably throws `AtDecryptionException` on an incorrect passphrase. The `jsonDecode` of the decrypted bytes now runs inside the decrypt try/catch, so wrong-passphrase garbage no longer escapes as an uncaught `FormatException` (an intermittent failure in `at_keys_io_test`).
