## at_invitation_flutter example

The at_invitation_flutter package is designed to make it easy to invite people through email or SMS into apps that use atProtocol.

### Give it a try
This package includes a working sample application in the [example](https://github.com/atsign-foundation/at_widgets/tree/trunk/at_invitation_flutter/example) directory that demonstrates the key features of the package. To create a personalized copy, use ```at_app create``` as shown below or check it out on GitHub.

```sh
$ flutter pub global activate at_app 
$ at_app create --sample=<package ID> <app name> 
$ cd <app name>
$ flutter run
```
Notes: 
1. You only need to run ```flutter pub global activate``` once
2. Use ```at_app.bat``` for Windows

## How it works

Like most applications built for the atPlatform, we start with the [at_onboarding_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/at_onboarding_flutter) widget which handles secure management of secret keys for an atsign as cryptographically secure replacement for usernames and passwords.

After onboarding, the share call can be integrated to send out an invite link using SMS or email.

The package includes a dialog box to select an option between SMS and email.


Like everything else we do, this package and even the sample application are open source software which means we love it when you gift us with your feedback, contributions and even any bugs that you help us to discover. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/atsign-foundation/at_widgets/blob/trunk/CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed guidance on how to setup tools, tests and make a pull request.
